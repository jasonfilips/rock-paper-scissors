            <strong>How to play:</strong> fox is shot by a hunter with a gun, 
            the hunter does not raise his head to Shoya(village head),
            and Shoya(village head) is turned into a fox. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>History:</strong> Sansukumi-ken (三すくみ拳) is a category of East Asian hand games played by using three hand gestures. 
            Ken games went into a period of decline in Japan after World War II. 
            One of the few surviving sansukumi-ken games is jan-ken, which was brought to the West in the 20th century as rock paper scissors. <br>
            <br>
            The most popular sansukumi-ken game in Japan was <strong>kitsune-ken (狐拳)</strong>, also known as tōhachiken (東八拳).
            In the game, a supernatural fox called a kitsune (狐) defeats the village head, the village head (庄屋) defeats the hunter, and the hunter (猟師) defeats the fox. 
            A distinct feature of kitsune-ken is that the game is played by making gestures with both hands.
